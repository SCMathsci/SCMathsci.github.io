I am a postdoctoral research associate at the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-science/faculty/mathematics-and-statistics), [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi). I work in the interface of Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science. More specifically, some of the projects that I am currently working on are: (1) manifold learning; (2) designing neural networks to solve inverse problems from hyperbolic partial differential equations; and (3) statistical optimality of finite approximate designs on compact (Riemannian) symmetric spaces. In the recent past, I worked on discrete and computational geometry, probabilistic learning via kernel density estimation, probability on compact symmetric space, time series analysis and lasso, optimal design for regression on Lie groups ... 

In Helsinki, I work on [Inverse Problems](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/inverse-problems). I am being funded by ERC advanced grant InversePDE - Geometric Methods in Inverse Problems for Partial Differential Equations, and [Centre of Excellence on Inverse Modelling and Imaging](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/centre-of-excellence-of-inverse-modelling-and-imaging) headed by [Prof. Matti Lassas](https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/lassas/). Previously, I was a postdoc at [Ruhr-Universität Bochum](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/), where I worked with [Prof. Johannes Lederer](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/en/forschung/bereiche/st/math-data-methoden/personen/lederer-johannes.html), [Prof. Holger Dette](https://math.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/faculty/professorships/stochastics/group-dette/staff/holger-dette/), and [Prof. Rainer von Sachs](https://uclouvain.be/fr/repertoires/rainer.vonsachs). Going further back in time, I received a PhD in [Computer and Systems Sciences](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/web/) from [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://main.tifr.res.in), Mumbai; [Prof. Hariharan Narayanan](https://www.tifr.res.in/~hariharan.narayanan/) was my thesis advisor at TIFR.

Much before that, I had had horrific experiences while delving into some of the 'more fancy' sounding stuff in mathematics. In Arizona, [Prof. Rabi Bhattacharya](https://www.math.arizona.edu/~rabi/) guided me in writing a master's thesis on lattice point problem in euclidean space. Later, in TIFR Mumbai, I wrote a master's thesis on automata --- dealing with infinite alphabets --- under supervision of [Prof. Paritosh Pandya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pandya58/).

In the 'prehistoric era', I took up an employment in [Indian Air Force](https://indianairforce.nic.in/) (IAF) as a soldier-cum-technician from 2002, and lasted there until (almost) the end of 2007.

From March 2015 until February 2024, I was associated to Sree Nirmal Ananda Ashram, Hooghly. I express my gratitude and indebtedness to the principal of the Ashram, Sree Nirmal Brahmachari Ji --- who provided me with shelter, food, and other necessities for sustenance as I needed them most.

In these pages you can find my research papers (in 'almost final' form), a fairly up-to-date brief academic résumé, and some historical nonsenses. Happy browsing!
